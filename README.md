The Java ATM simulation code features core operations:
- Authentication: Users enter a PIN for access.
- Menu: Options include balance check, withdrawal, deposit, and exit.
- Operations: Basic banking tasks with balance checks.
- User Interaction: Utilizes `Scanner` for console input.
- Project Entry: `ATMMachine` initiates the project.
- Flow: Authentication, menu interaction, and repeating operations.
- Enhancements: Basic security, error handling, and potential for UI/UX improvements.
This foundational project provides a simple platform for more complex ATM simulations.
